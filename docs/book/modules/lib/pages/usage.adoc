== Crate features

`alloc`::

  Enables features that require an allocator. This is enabled by default
  (implied by `std`).

`std`::

  Enables features that depend on the standard library. This is enabled by
  default.

== `no_std` support

This supports `no_std` mode. Disables the `default` feature to enable this.

Note that the memory blocks used by Argon2 when calculating a derived key is
limited to 256 KiB when the `alloc` feature is disabled.
