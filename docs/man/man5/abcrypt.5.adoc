== NAME

abcrypt - abcrypt encrypted data format

== DESCRIPTION

*{manname}* is a modern file encryption format with the data authenticity
inspired by the {scrypt-encrypted-data-format}[scrypt encrypted data format],
which is produced by the {tarsnap-scrypt}[scrypt encryption utility].

It uses Argon2 as defined in {rfc9106}[RFC 9106] for key derivation,
BLAKE2b-512-MAC as defined in {rfc7693}[RFC 7693] for header integrity checking
and XChaCha20-Poly1305 as defined in
{draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha}[draft-irtf-cfrg-xchacha] for encryption.

=== File format structure

An {manname} file is composed of two parts: the header containing the required
data and the payload encrypted with the derived key.

|Offset |Bytes |Description

|0

|===

All multibyte values are stored in little-endian.

=== Filename extension

{manname} files should use the extension `.abcrypt`.

=== MIME type

When transferring {manname} files over the Internet, the appropriate MIME type
is `application/x-abcrypt`.
